# MachineLearningProjects
This repository is a compilation of simple data analysis and machine learning projects perfomed in the Python/Jupyter environment. It is for the purpose of teaching machine learning methods. It teaches the uses of Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, SciPy, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, etc. We will learn both Supervised and Unsupervised learning methods. 

1. Hypothesis Testing (AnalysisOfGoogleAppRatings)
   In this short project, we perform analysis of the user rating of free and paid apps on Google Play to test if there is a statistically significant difference between them.
2. Supervised Learning Methods (UserVehiclePrices)
   In this short project, we apply supervised learning methods to a dataset of used cars listed on Craigslist to precit prices of used cars.
